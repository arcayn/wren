# wren

Wren is an effort to produce an open-source library of classical cipher implementations, and easy-to-use, efficient analysis and solving tools.
It grew out of the [PyKrak](https://github.com/arcayn/pykrak) project as a competitive C++ port. Our general aims for the future are to use the platform to create an
advanced suite of analysis tools which can be applied at the cutting edge of heuristic-based computational cryptanalysis, and beat current closed-source alternatives
not just in flexibility, but also solve speed and solve range.
